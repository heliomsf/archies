# archies
I want to build a website that works as an architecture catalog, organized by location (coordinates, neighbourhoods, cities, countries) and where buildings are shown as cards, airbnb style. Users will be able to create, read, update and delete buildings, add pictures to existing buildings, create, read, update and delete their reviews and rate the buildings with 1 to 5 stars. I'll be using Rails as a framework, and PostgreSQL for the database, as well as Git for version control, with help from Github Copilot. This project is strictly for learning and training purposes.
